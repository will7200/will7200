### Introducing Word Bites Solver [link](https://will7200.github.io/WordBites-Solver/)
I have been enjoying the new game word-bites on game pigeon. They implemented a new feature that gives all the wordsWorker possible on the game that is really cool. The only downside is that is quite expensive to utilize. So i made this app to help with that. There are multiple dictionary that the user can choose from to filter out the words possible.
